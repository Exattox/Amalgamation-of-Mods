## üì¶ How to Download

1. **Click the green "Releases" tab** ‚Üí [Go to Releases](../../releases)
2. Download the `.zip` file under the latest release (e.g., `Amalgamation.zip`)
3. Extract the zip somewhere (Desktop is fine)
4. Inside, you'll find a `mods/` folder ‚Äî crack it open

---

## üõ† How to Install

You have two options:

### Option 1: Full Replace
- Delete your current `mods` folder
- Copy/paste the one from the zip into:
  ### %AppData%\Balatro\mods


### Option 2: Manual Merge
- Open your own `mods` folder
- Drag the individual mod folders from the zip into yours
- Overwrite if you're updating something

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
This modpack **does not come with [Lovely](https://github.com/karai17/lovely)** ‚Äî  
You **must** have Lovely installed separately, or the mods will not work.

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

- If something breaks, it's probably because the mod authors are smarter than me.
- Credits go to the original mod creators ‚Äî I just duct-taped it together.

Enjoy the chaos.
